								</a></h2>
									<p>In this project, I used SQL SERVER to clean and transform housing raw data in order to make it usable for analysis. 
										The data used for this project was the Nashville Housing Dataset, and this is what was done with the data:
										
										1. Cleaned the Data.
										
										2. Standardized date format using CONVERT.
										
										3. Broke out Addresses into individual columns (Address, City, State) using SUBSTRING and PARSENAME.
										
										4. Removed duplicates.
										
										5. Deleted unused columns.
										
										This project was really eye-opening, and it's great how in just a day I've been able to learn both how to explore and clean data with SQL.<br />
